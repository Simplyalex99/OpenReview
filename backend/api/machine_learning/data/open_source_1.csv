Not a good look Brad. He was friendly but just looked and smelt a little funky. The toilets were ok had the amenities however looked like they could do with a good deep clean. Whilst waiting at the door to leave a member of staff walked in with a woman who went straight to the toilet who was clearly not in the same room as us totally spaced out kids were totally shocked at this sight they are not used to seeing things like this and felt a little uneasy.

We then saw that if you got a ‚Äúpermit‚Äù from someone at a register & you put it in your window and parked at a Pizza Hut space, you wouldn‚Äôt be towed. We waited for our pizza to be towed and literally 4 cars towed in less than 30 minutes. The guy at the Cuban grocery next to Pizza Hut, sat outside and took photos of the cars without permits. Then the waiting tow truck would zoom and and tow them. The Pizza Hut knows what‚Äôs going on because they have a stack of these permits. All 4 cars towed belonged to non-English tourists. We had to wait 45 minutes for our pizza anyway. We saw some tourists paying off the tow truck driver. This is called sharking. The news media needs to get involved (ABC news? ‚ÄúWhat would you do?‚Äù) and put an end to this! It‚Äôs ridiculous!! ",1,a,0.6796420102775796,0
"After a long day travelling, we went to the Pizza Hut in front of Rosen Inn at Pointe Orlando. We had probably the worst service experience ever in the US. It was so bad we had to talk to a manager. Long wait times, wrong orders, meals brought out a different times, no cutlery with meals. Eventually got given plastic cutlery. The manager did discount the bill but by then we just wanted to fish and leave. Needless to say, no tips were left, despite the recommendation of 15 to 20% on the bill. Certainly won‚Äôt be back. Really wasted the first day of our holiday.",1,a,0.6796420102775796,0
"Was greeted by Brad who was great and sat us down, and Marie came over to take our order.All was going well until someone behind the counter who we could not see kept shouting Brad continuously.Was funny for about a minute but this went continuously through our meal.Brad was great and laughed it all off, in the U.K. This is called bullying.We won't be returning for a meal, so whoever you were your now costing your restaurant money.Brad, your a star, pity you have to work will bullying idiots.",2,a,0.6796420102775796,0
Pizza Hut is pretty much the same food wise wherever you go - if you like the pizzas then the food is good and this place is no different. Good deep pan meat lovers. Was right across the road from the Rosen Inn where we were staying so handy for a quick bite - daughters got take out a couple of days too. Service was good and friendly but there was an odd smell in the place - think it was some type of cleaning product which is never a nice smell when you are eating.,3,a,0.6796420102775796,0
"This is involving vehicle towing that is quite different from the previous reviews I‚Äôve read. My wife and I were tourist from Atlanta and thought we would stop by Pizza Hut to have a fresh hot pizza for a change on the evening of 12/12/18. There were very few vehicles in the lot at that time, therefore we parked near the front door and went directly into the restaurant. When we finished dining around an hour, we returned to where we parked. We were shocked when we discovered our vehicle was gone. We immediately assumed someone had stolen it. We frantically circled the bldg. a couple times and then spoke with the manager inside, Clark. After explaining what happened and providing a description of the vehicle, we were again shocked when he told us that our vehicle had been towed. I asked why. He asked me for my Pizza Hut receipt. I was again overwhelmed, confused and frustrated when we were informed that our vehicle was towed by mistake. He then advised us the vehicle would be returned in an hour and there would be no charge. I guess when he told us there would be no charge, he assumed we would be overly joyed. But realizing the fact I had abided by the signs posted in the lot that stated unauthorized vehicles parked in the lot will be towed at owner‚Äôs expense, I felt a charge was not justifiable anyhow because I was authorized and I committed no violation. When the flatbed tow truck finally arrived with the vehicle, for some reason it remained on the truck parked in the dark on the street in the rear of the bldg. for an additional 30 to 45 mins. At the end of this incident, I truly can say whatever enjoyment my wife and I got from our dining experience was obliterated by this unnecessary, irresponsible and unbelievable incident that occurred. The remainder of our vacation night and the potential memorable experiences we could have had were taken away from us by a simple mistake by Pizza Hut that should not have occurred in the first place. And what made it more outrageous was the fact that the restaurant manager did not offer us one thing for the stress we experienced and the wasted time and inconvenience created by this incident created by them. This was the first time in my 50 years of driving I have been towed on the premise of illegal parking. If I was parked illegally, I would be willing to accept the consequences. However, I believe Pizza Hut should be willing to accept whatever consequences would be fair to resolve this matter.",1,a,0.6796420102775796,0

Restaurant had one other couple in which should have been the first clue. It was freezing the air con was on too high. The waitress was so loud talking to other staff at the counter all the time we ate we had to hear about her personal life and Thanksgiving plans. She walked a few steps to our table to bring a drink and the pizza but when she billed us she wrote on the back of the bill how much we should tip her!! I left a 20% tip because I felt I had to because that‚Äôs what she wrote and expected but I won‚Äôt be back. ,1,a,0.6796420102775796,0
I placed a delivery order to come to a nearby resort. After an hour I called to check on the status and was told they had no name room number or phone number - all were provided when I ordered.

During our 4 day visit in Orlando we wanted to eat at Pizza Hut.... as we drove up the empty parking we decided to do some fast shopping in CVS next door...... when we came back our car got towed away as pizza Hut defined us as ‚Äònon customers‚ÄôWhen we entered the restaurant to explain that we are in fact customers all we got was arrogance....... it was clear to us why the parking was empty as the dirty restaurant had nu customers, just arrogant employees and an even more arrogant ‚Äòmanager‚ÄôShame on you Pizza Hut, this scam just costed you customers (but as the ‚Äòmanager‚Äô said: you wouldn‚Äôt care less, there are enough customers left) ",1,a,0.6796420102775796,0

"Chose Pizza Hut as it was directly across from our hotel and we wanted a cheap meal after an exhausting day at the parks. Food was ok, wine was awful (not that I expected much from a fast food chain). Place was most definitely not the cleanest and had an awful smell. We went here for a cheap meal... how wrong we were. Our bill was $20 more than Millars Ale House the previous evening where we had 2 glasses of wine each!!!!The worst part is the 20% service they hand write on the bill. I would say we are the type that actually overtip, however we felt 20% was excessive in this case. I queried whether it was compulsory to which they said it wasn't so I said I would pay 10%... the attitude very much shifted. We won't be going back nor recommending!",2,a,0.6796420102775796,0

We should have known thatvthis was going to be a culinary nughtmare when the waitress got our drinks oder wrong and then just didnt return when we asked for a straw! I gave up waiting inntje end and got it myself. Of the 2 pizza we ordered one arrived stone cold and the other was not much better. Sent it back and then told by the waitress that she had personally made a new pizza. When the new pizza arrived it was disgusting! It was absolutely swimming in grease. It you love food and value yoyrnhard earned money then I would advise you not to eat here especially when there are so many nice eateries nearby. I could maybe excuse our waitress and maybe say that she was over worked as the place just didn't seem to have much staff. Or maybe I should just say that she had no customer relation skills whatsoever and just didn't give a stuff for her customers. I visited this restaurant approx 2 years ago and It has noticeably gone downhill since especially as it seems to be scrapping the barrel with the staff that it employs!,1,a,0.6796420102775796,0

When the pizzas came, the supreme pizza had black olives on it, which were not supposed to be on that pizza. We told the waitress she said ok I will get you another one, with no apology. Shortly after she came over and asked if we wanted anything else, we said yes could we have two more beers. When she brought them over she slammed them out on the table and never spoke, this made us feel really uncomfortable. After we had finished eating we asked her for the bill, she brought it over and added herself a 20% tip on top of the bill, which I found really disgusting after the service we had received from this waitress",1,a,0.6796420102775796,0

I told her that we didn't want them an hour and a half waiting for a few pizzas and her reply was"" well they will only end up in the trash,"" and I told her "" that's were they deserve to be.

In 2015-2017-2018 2015-2017 I went with family they aren‚Äôt quick to serve you when you walk in and the restaurant may only have 2 tables in and the staff are standing round having a good laugh with each other talking about what they did at weekend and the night before! I went this May between 15th May to the 30th! And noticed that nothing sadly in this store had changed! I went with 3 friends to find the Pizza Hut on international drive had more staff than customers in. The staff that working in the back had EarPods in and were listening to music very very unprofessional! And the staff that were meant to be waiting on customers having a good chat! Has to wait 15 mins for a table???? Why when they only had one family of 4 in sat eating at a table already! Service for meNot the best would I go again once visiting Florida! (NO) As I‚Äôve been let down over the years to many times nothing has changed! As I say 2015-2017-2018 and they wonder why they didn‚Äôt get tipped!

The pizzas were generous and tasty shame about the plates which arrived wet and that we had to dry ourselves with tissues.Nobody cleared the table next to us during our stay and boxes were piled on chairs nearby.The waiter made us wait a while for our dessert as it seems he had forgotten to forward the order to the kitchen. Nonetheless we went to pay happy enough with our dinner even preparing to leave a tip as we had done everywhere else during our stay. The bill came a bit as a shock as the waiter added a compulsory 20% service charge to our bill tax included of about $14!I questioned him about it but it seems normal to him.We decided against returning there during our holiday.

"Had the displeasure of eating at what can only be described as the venue of hell out of a hell hole. Was in the states from the 1st to 9th of August and decided to call in here for a salad one evening. Booths were disgraceful in need of decoration. We were seated and we asked for a coffee with milk and a coke. Got served with a coffee and some pots of half and half but no coke or sugar. Asked for sugar to be told, ""Sorry, I don't think there's any in the restaurant but we've got sweeteners,"" told them, ""No we'ed like sugar please."" A time later 3 sachets of sugar got delivered to the table and the server walked off. After a while we got his attention and asked him for a spoon, we got a spoon and then my coke delivered. A time after that our salads got delivered. We sat there laughing for a while until another server looked and asked us if we needed knives and forks. We told him we did and that we had ordered extra dressings and another coke. He duly obliged but told us that, ""He'd had to run to the back of the store,"" to get the extra dressings for us. A point that I couldn't care less about. As this was going on our original server commenced to walk about the premises throwing his arms up in the air and moan about everyone and everything, very funny to watch but a pathetic attitude. As time went on, oh by the way the salads were the worst we have experienced, our original server became interested in his tip and asked us if all was in order. I'd lost the will to live at this stage and and paid giving him a $2 tip. His face and bottom lip hit the floor.

The smell of garlic, cheese and a growling belly did the rest.I was initially thinking of the two ingredients on a small pizza, but when my server suggested their new signature wings with a range of sauces liberally tossed on them, I was swayed. I ordered garlic parmiagana boneless wings and lemon pepper fries. A soda filled my order while I waited.For a fast food restaurant, the food din't exactly come out quickly. The establishment wasn't heaving at lunchtime, with about twnety other patrons sitting at various other booths. I'm not sure if the kitchen was short staffed, but the two servers on the floor were trying to fill the humdrum in between taking orders and preparation for the evening. In short, they weren't busy and yet the my food took almost twenty minutes to arrive on my table.The wings were very tasty and moreish. The fries however, were overcooked.

It had be 18 years since I was in Orlando an I remember eating here a few times then so I was looking forward to a good pizza oh how wrong was I . First it looked exactly the same 18years ago looking a bit dated. Staff were very nice can't fault them but the pizza we got was full of grease and I mean the base was soggy with it Iowa's so hungry and tired that I had some of it took the rest back to the room only to bin it later. If never has a pizza base soaked in grease and I'm pretty sure it not meant to be like this yuck.

Situated opposite pointe Orlando and in front of Rosen inn pointe its central for I-drive. You can dine in or order a take out at a designated area inside. The food was tasty but the toppings were clearly just thrown on due to some slices having hardly any. The main issue is the girl behind the till clearly is in the wrong job. She is moody with colleagues/customers and does the bare minimum. There were no deals available and the menu displayed no special offers either. $32 for 2 medium pizzas is slightly expensive. Average pizza with poor service but ideally located. ,3,a,0.6796420102775796,0
"On arrival, greeted pretty well, waitress took us to 3 different tables before she found a clean one, we ordered our drinks then she came back and took our food order, the order arrived fairly promptly, on the good side it looked delicious , my husband ordered a pizza, which he said was very tasty, I ordered an Italian salad , which included 2 rotten 1/2's of cherry tomatoes, when the waitress came to clear the plates we mentioned to her that she needed to have s word with the chef about serving poor quality food she took the plate with the tomatoes on in to the kitchen and came back and just said a rather feeble sorry, I myself work in the food industry and would have been mortified if I'd had that bought back to me, I will not be recommending this outlet to anyone .",2,a,0.6796420102775796,0
"If you're used to pizza huts in the UK then maybe avoid this one. The waiter was great, very helpful & friendly. The pizza was what you'd expect so no complaints there (medium size one was $15.99) but the place DESPERATELY needs a whole refurb! It's dated & in my opinion doesn't look too clean..a whole world apart from pizza huts in the UK and there's no salad buffet. ",3,a,0.6796420102775796,0

We were staying in the Rosen Pointe and used the website to order for collection twice.Food both times was good. Great value for what you get with the $20 3 box deal!However both times the staff were quite poor. Second time was busyer and order/collection was total chaos. Why two people can't take payments I don't understand. Why there can't be a dedicated pick up till I don't know as there's clearly the demand for it.Was OK for us as we were 1 min away but maybe be wary of travelling to pick up.,3,a,0.6796420102775796,0
"We attended here on its first day of opening up again. The restaurant was half full and both waiters were very stressed and it felt as though they couldn't wait to get rid of us.

"Just back from a evening on I drive we called into Pizza Hut me my partner son and baby.Service was so slow waited around 15 mins to be acknowledged, drinks the took another 15 mins to come, food in general was ok apart from the Meat Lovers Pizza that was so salty my self or our party couldn't eat it, my son had complained since it came to table how salty it was.Manager came over to see us and told us that if they made another it would be the same !!!!

We arrived at 7.30pm on a Thursday evening - 3 adults and 4 children under 9yrs. Waited about 15 mins before we were even acknowledged. Other groups of people who arrived after us didn't receive an acknowledgement or explanation despite waiting 20 minutes or so and many left as a result of the poor/slow service. We were told there would be a 30 min wait for a table despite there being visibly empty booths and people leaving. We offered to split into 2 smaller groups of 4 and 3 so could be seated more easily but were told this would not be any quicker. 'Hostesses' Ali and Bonnie refused to seat us in the empty booths saying the kitchen was backed up and so they would not be taking our order anyway. They were rude and snappy towards customers and seemed to be selectively seating white customers over ethnic minority groups of the same size who had arrived earlier.....After waiting 40 minutes we were told our party would have to wait at least a further 30-40 minutes at which point we asked to speak to the manager. The manager Anthony only appeared out front at this time and seemed completely out of his depth and unable to cope with the pressure of managing front of house and kitchen at the same time. He was unhelpful and seemed to have no idea what his front of house staff were doing/saying to customers. He claimed the restaurant had only opened a couple of days ago and the kitchen staff were struggling to cope with the orders coming through the restaurant and delivery/collection service. The restaurant looked to be at about 80% capacity so I shudder to think of how they would cope on a busy weekend service! This restaurant and the staff working here are ruining the reputation of Pizza Hut and fall miserably short of the standards usually exhibited by Pizza Hut employees and franchise. The employees we encountered on our visit are a disgrace to the Pizza Hut brand and should not be working at a busy International Drive location if they do not have the skills/expertise/ethics to do so. Don't waste your time/money at this branch of Pizza Hut - walk a few steps across/up/down International Drive and have an enjoyable dining experience instead!,1,a,0.6796420102775796,0

The food was good although the marinara sauce was a little bland and thin compared to what we are used to. Overall I think there are better options. We ate there because we were staying at the Comfort Inn Gateway hotel, we couldn't check into our room yet and we had just got to the area from the Airport, we were walking because we didn't have a car.

I quickly called back since we were having pasta with the pizza and could not eat it with our fingers, they put me on hold and never picked.I suggest since one of your sides is pasta when ordering a pizza special, automatically send napkins, forks and plates.

"So during our stay in Orlando at the Hyatt we ordered pizza a total of 3 times. (In fact I should say attempted to order)1. First order was online, and the food never showed. I called them three times. Once at 7:45 when my pizza was already 15 minutes late, then at 8 (both times they said the driver was out and should be there soon) and again at 8:30 (which is when they informed me they didn't have an order under my name or number, despite the fact I had a confirmation number and email from them)2. A couple days later we decided to have a pizza party with some friends and called pizza hut to order (because I would think actually talking to a human being would help make sure the order actually made it to their system) We were quoted 30 minutes. Our pizza didn't show up for an hour. I called to inform them I would not being paying for cold pizza because this was insane.3. I also called on our last night in Orlando. I mentioned the last two fiascos and asked that they give me a realistic time frame for when the order would arrive. They took my confirmation number this time and said that apparently it had been cancelled at their end. So I asked to speak to a manager regarding this. They hung up on me.As someone who has worked in the pizza business for 4 years, I found it absolutely appalling how awful their customer service was. Plus the one time I did actually get my pizza, it was overcooked and quite possibly reheated/been sitting around for a while.Not impressed. I'd advise going elsewhere. The only reason they got 3 chances was because I had friends with me that actually like their pizza.",1,a,0.6796420102775796,0
Me and my other half went here for a lite bite. We got seated promptly but our server took a long time to greet us. After waiting 10 minutes maybe more she come over and wanted to know what we wanted to eat before asking what drinks we would like. So we made a haste decision then got asked what drinks we wanted. The food didn't take long about 15 minutes to come out. Our server walked out with our food went straight past us and seen ankther table for drinks. Which i thought was quite rude.The pizza was absolutely lovely couldn't fault It. Halfway through our meal the server dumped our bill on our table. We felt like then we had to rush to finish to leave. After eating we waited for our server to come over and take our card but she ignored us and was seeing to another table which had a larger party. We fully understand that this larger party would have the higher bill than me and my other half. But it doesn't excuse the ignorance on our servers behalf. After waiting 20 minutes she finally come over saying she forgotten about us as a table. Absolutely disgusted. She even made a point of leaving her a tip. If it wasn't necessary she wouldn't of got anything.Think next time we'll order the pizza and just take it back to our hotel. ,3,a,0.6796420102775796,0

She was just rude, her personality and demeanor was just negative and nasty. She messed up our order because she was rushing or maybe not paying attention to us because didn't want to deal with us or I don't know what. Never coming back to this place whenever I saty near by.

And most annoying of all, the server whose disinterest was plainly evident wrote the tip he thought he was worth on the check, circled it and underlined it - i know im a tourist but i do know the tipping ethiquete in the US, i don't appreciate when someone assumes i'm stupid and i don't appreciate bad service just because i'm a tourist and unlikely to be back.

If we had been eating in We would have sent it back but since it was a take out order we did not have that option. While waiting for our pizza we did walk around the restaurant and it seemed very large and in good condition. But the meal is the thing.

"I was on business, so I was in Orlando for business and visited this location in July 2014. I ordered a personal pan pizza and a mountain dew. I had to rate this restaurant in categories, so I shall explain my ratings.ServiceThe service was not bad. I noticed a server cheerful, offering suggestions, checked in and was basically interactive without being intrusive. Unfortunately, I did not get that server. While mine was not rude or bad, it was just painfully slow. Painfully. Slow. While the drink order came fast, placing an order for the food was the duration of 2 Tom and Jerry snippets, or 10 minutes. To get my food took a whole episode of Tom and Jerry, or 30 minutes. To get my bill, took another episode of Tom and Jerry; I finish my meal in 5ish minutes. Possibly quicker if I am eating alone. However, I would like to reiterate, he was never rude or bad. So in my hour and 10 minutes, I managed to eat 2 slices of my pizza and drink 1 drink.Food:I admit, I love pizza hut pizzas. I crave them sometimes. I, however, have never found one that cooks it consistently good like the ones produced in the days of when they were eat-ins. I guess that is why I was a little disappointed. What I received (a personal pan cheese pizza) was this undercooked plop of a thing. The pizza was pretty tasteless. It was floppy and undercooked. I didn't bother taking 1/2 of the pizza I didn't eat home.Value:Considering the service was slow, and the pizza sucked, the value pretty much blows. I ate on a budget, but I still consider it a waste of money considering, I went to another restaurant within 10 minutes of leaving.Atmosphere:So here's the deal (for those who plan on driving there). When you park, there are signs that say something like ""If you park here, you have to immediately walk into the restaurant."" While in good faith (free parking is a premium in the area), it also sends a paranoid feeling. Like they are watching you. I tested it. I stopped and smoked a cigarette. I fully expected a manager or employee to come flying out telling me to move my car, or have me towed, or whatever. Or I concocted this idea in my head they were watching me on camera. Seeing how many steps I took away from my car. None of that happened. I don't think they knew I didn't immediately walk into the restaurant.Once in, it was semi-clean. With great views of the parking garage of Pointe Orlando. The only good thing, the reason I rated them a 2 instead of a 1 was they had Tom and Jerry playing on their tv. I simply love the cartoon Tom and Jerry. It makes me laugh and happy. So, kudos!",2,a,0.6796420102775796,0

"We called into this Pizza Hut tonight (20th June 14) to grab a quick pizza before nipping off to Sea World for a couple of hours.It was pretty empty and there were a couple of staff gossiping at the till with what appeared to be three others sitting at a table having just eaten or at least, taken a break. We asked where we should sit and we were told ""anywhere"" and pretty much left to it. We looked around and suffice to say, it's not the cleanest restaurant we've ever been in.We sat there for about ten minutes, enough time to see two goals in the World Cup match on the TV, however no one came to take a drinks order. A family came in, were seated, plates provided and drinks delivered. We sat and waited. The three staff finished at their table in the restaurant and walked past us without acknowledging us. Still we waited. After about 15 minutes, we decided that the staff were not going to serve us, stood up and headed to the door, no one asking us why we were leaving.We stopped a waitress and told her that we had been there for a quarter of an hour and were going to find somewhere else to eat as we were disappointed with the lack of service. ""That's fine "" was her response.Well it might be fine for her but let me tell you, Sizzlers next door, Millers across the road, Maggianos, Roma's, TGI's and many more in the area will all appreciate your custom and treat you like a valued friend.

We didn't notice it at the moment, as we paid by creditcard, but when we checked the receipt afterwards we were shocked to see that she had tipped herself...

Very disappointed with this Pizza Hut. Visited as a family of four for an evening meal. Seated fairly quickly but table was dirty (top and the sides).

"The host was very rude. He never took names down, just tried to remember us by the number in our party. After sitting for 30 minutes waiting for a table with 2 young children, he began to seat a party of more people who came in after us. When my husband asked what was going on he said that he asked us if we were carrying out and we didn't answer??!! We then told him that he hadn't asked us anything and that we needed to be seated before the other party and were rudely told to go to the open table. Our waiter was very friendly, however, but he then told us they were out of pan pizza and the wait would be about 40 minutes for a pizza. When our food finally arrived, it was fine, but the problem was that when we got our bill. It was $45 for two pizzas, and order of wings and an order of breadsticks. We just thought, oh well, we are in a tourist area. It's bound to be more. The next day as we were driving past that same Pizza Hut, the billboard had a ""special"" going for exactly what we had ordered the night before for $15 less. It is beyond me why we wouldn't have just been given the special price. After that I was thoroughly upset with that Pizza Hut and we made jokes about it every time we passed it. The staff was very disorganized and it was definitely not the cleanest place.

"Coming from the UK, the expectations of Pizza Hut are fairly standrd. This is the worst Pizza Hut I have ever been in. The minute we waked in to the restaurant all you could smell was the stench of cheese, I love cheese but this cheese was sickening. We were at a table in a corner which was perfect, however our server was not. He did not make the effort when we sat down and wasn't pleasant, felt like it was a chore serving us. We overheard him saying to anther table that he wasn't with it tonight because he had tables inside and out - if you cannot cope, front of house staff should not be placing customers in that section. The food, the food was OK. Nothing special, edible but smelling the stench of strong cheesy cheese was off putting. Overall, I would choose a different restaurant completely unless you are absolutely desperate. When receiving the bill, gratuity had NOT been added on but he put on the bottom of the receipt optional gratuity, which was $5 on top of the fairly expensive bill which we did not think was professional nor did he deserve that.

Our $20 pizza ended up costing us over $200 after we had to take a taxi ($40) to get our towed vehicle ($125).

"Do not patronize Pizza Hut restaurants on I-Drive. They tow customers in their parking lot. Good luck trying to argue with the tow company about which restaurant you walked into. On one hand, I can understand why they might do it to prevent cars sitting there all night, but that is not what is going on. It's predatory. When I parked in the Pizza hut parking lot, it was half empty, plenty of spaces. I didn't see the tow sign at all. Since I-Drive is very crowded, I thought it would be safer to stay in one parking space, eat, and also pop in an attraction across the street. (All the businesses are sharing the same tourist dollars, so what does it matter). But after only 20 minutes, I was towed. The taxi driver was very nice, and saw me immediately. She basically admitted this is what she does for a living, cruise around picking up tourists who were towed. So I ended up paying almost 200 dollars to get my car back, between the tow and taxi. The tow company said a tear mysteriously appeared in my tire, causing the air to release, and they charged me $35 to put air in my tire, also. Pizza Hut management is involved, because I was told the tow truck driver had the restaurant manager come out to look at the vehicle and witness that the tire was flat. I thought this was really bizarre. What interest does Pizza Hut managers have in parking lot issues? And I wonder if the corporate office of Pizza Hut knows this is going on, or agreed to cover liability for their employees while they're fussing in the parking lot with cars. The tow company and Pizza Hut managers must make a nice living with this kind of practice.But you'll never get me on that street again, as a tourist.

It loses a star because the venue could be nicer (better kept) -- they share the spot with several other chain foods so not clear who is at fault for that. Chicken wings are great (the full size ones).",3,z,0.40028208347497907,0

"We visited this KFC in 2012 and had the most disgusting KFC meal. We could not stomach one bite, it was oily, old and smelly. A week ago we went back thinking its changed, it was worse than 2012. A lady with a thick foreign accent served us with such an arrogant attitude, she was irritated that we couldn't understand a word that she spoke.¬†The chips were dark brown and rock hard, it was refried for the past week. Chicken was beyond disgusting, scone was so stale that it crumbled when we picked it up. Once again we left our meal without eating. When you see an empty restaurant, it's an indication of how bad the food is. It surprises me how KFC on 7th street manages to still operate right next to Times Square.",1,z,0.40028208347497907,0
"not the best KFC I've eaten in , seating area is downstairs and absolutely stunk of body odour as there were no windows couldn't wait to get out of there and left quite a bit of the meal to achieve this.",1,z,0.40028208347497907,0
"they dont have fries, no zinger burgers the chicken burger was so dry and the pieces of chicken was so greasy",2,z,0.40028208347497907,0
"this is far beyond a nice place to eat, it comes leaking oil and the taste it`s the worse you can get, if you want to eat unhealthy go to another fast food, KFC is a stroke waiting to happen.",2,z,0.40028208347497907,0
"Imagine that you are coming from Central Park you are so tired and starving please consider another option just before to visit this place, Chicken taste is so grassy, dinner room smells like hell and finally you want to go to the restrooms and you noted that clean, ergonomic and human acceptable are not the terms that they know.. Few words: go to another place!",1,z,0.40028208347497907,0
"KFC Times square was the worst ever! Service took forever. The staff at the till did not even know their own menu. Shabby restaurant. They had downstairs seating which smelt like a dumpster. We ordered a 5 piece meal with mash and gravy and biscuits. The chicken was oily and awful, we ended up wasting our entire meal. The glass at the Times square KFC was cracked and the entire outlet just shocking. In South Africa our KFC is a 1000 times better. Ironic considering that KFC originated in the US. This store is one for undercover boss to investigate and quickly!",2,z,0.40028208347497907,0
"Disgusting! Please do not go! I agree with another reviewer when saying this should be closed down. A South Asian employee was yelling and being so incredibly rude to an African employee. When the 'manager,' another African employee stepped in, he didn't do anything. The South Asian employee was degrading the other girl and treating customers so poorly. She had no customer service and probably the worst service ever. I wanted to say nevermind, but I had waited for over 20 minutes to get my food. I failed to realize and no one mentioned it was only thighs and drumsticks, gross. The potato wedges aren't even potato wedges. I don't know what they are. It was just so dirty and disgusting.. Even the building was gross.. No thanks!!",1,z,0.40028208347497907,0
"Went here on a trip to New York. I have to say it is probably the most disgusting and unhygienic restaurant I have ever come across in my life. This is an embarrassment to New York, Times Square and KFC because it is a good chain of restaurant. You would think to have a restaurant in Times Square would be an honour. The staff were fine and clearly trying there hardest what it seems is lacking is management or anybody that cares about the restaurant. Has nobody walked around and seen the sheet of plastic ripped off the tables. Numerous dirty tables it absolutely stinks and the stairs on the way down are just thick with dirt. I really can't stress how much to avoid this place go to Mcdonalds or someone that cares about there restaurant. I dread to think if that is what the customer part was like what dire state the kitchen must be in. I feel sick thinking about it",1,z,0.40028208347497907,0
"Definitely the worst KFC we have ever visited, the service was unhelpful & rude, the cleanliness and hygiene were well below acceptable standards and the downstairs seating area stunk. In fairness the food tasted OK but we couldn't wait to leave, and shuddered each time we passed by for the remainder of our holiday",1,z,0.40028208347497907,0
"One goes to restaurants like KFC for economically priced food, which maintains a certain quality. However, we were shocked at the quality of food at t his KFC, and that too close to Times Square. Is this because we are tourists and are taken for granted. The service was not too great, the food was terrible. The chicken was full of oil, the salad uneatable. We had gone there late evening, it looked as if we were given leftovers! Would be careful to go to KFCs in the future.",1,z,0.40028208347497907,0
"Counter employee named Elizabeth had no customer service skills at all, barked at customers and when she said there would be a wait for certain items, never said how long the wait would be, saw people leave due to her attitude and poor customer service, she acted as if customers were bothering her by wanting to order",2,z,0.40028208347497907,0
